The princess had been raised as a commoner, humble and kind, forever committed to the ideals of service. The day they brought her the crown expecting her to swoon and cry for joy, she kicked it clear off the velvet cushion, the jewels glittering until they fell into the farmyard muck.

No sooner was she crowned than she was back on the streets in peasant clothes, only this time with her entourage of palace cooks to give bread to every hungry stomach.
